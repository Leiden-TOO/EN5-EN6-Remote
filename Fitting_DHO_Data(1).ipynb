    "# EN2a Session 1: Fitting Dampened Harmonic Oscillator Data\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the basic steps of analysing the data you obtained from your experiment with the RLC circuit. Before you start, make sure that you have some good data from the experiment and that you have saved your data as one or more .csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to explain your work in your lab journal! You don't have to print your Python code and glue it in, but the steps of your reasoning should be clear from your lab journal *alone*. As always, a picture says more than a thousand words: putting your graphs in the lab journal is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you have already finished the Programming Methods course, which means that you've already seen the NumPy and Matplotlib modules. We don't expect you to be fluent Python programmers yet, so we will walk you through the steps of fitting the data for this experiment. Later, you will be able to use these skills during the open experiments.\n",

    "Using the data you obtained, we want to do two things. First of all, we want to find the characteristic time $\\tau$ of the pink exponential function (see figure). Secondly, we want to determine the frequency of the wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"plan of attack\" will be: first, we filter only local maxima from your data. The exponential is meant to pass right through these maxima, so we will fit an exponential function through these maxima. From the parameters of the fit, we can read off the characteristic time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need quite some tools to make this work. Obviously, we will be using NumPy and Matplotlib, but we will also use SciPy. SciPy is a library with specialized tools for scientific research. It contains, amongst others, functions for fitting functions to data, and finding local maxima.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy and Matplotlib Recap\n",
    "To get reaquinted will NumPy and Matplotlib, study the next two cells of code. In the code, I define two NumPy arrays: one for the x- and one for the y-axis of my graph. The NumPy array for the y-axis is filled with a sine wave. I then graph the sine wave.\n",

    "Try changing the frequency of the sine wave. Can you add labels and a title to the plot? And can you change the range of the x-axis? \n",
